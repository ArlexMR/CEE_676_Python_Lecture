The notebooks in this repository are designed to guide your first steps in using Python for hydrologic analyses. The notebooks in the [**ReferenceModules**](https://github.com/ArlexMR/CEE_676_Python_Lecture/tree/main/ReferenceModules) folder demonstrate basic Python syntax and common libraries for data analysis (NumPy and Pandas). The notebooks in the [**Exercises**](https://github.com/ArlexMR/CEE_676_Python_Lecture/tree/main/Exercises) folder contain a series of practical exercises to reinforce what you’ve learned.

Keep in mind that this material doesn’t intend to cover all the basics of Python. Rather, it aims to give you a first glance at what coding looks like. However, after completing the exercises, you may feel more confident to move forward and improve your coding skills. There is extensive, freely available online material that you can use to learn.
