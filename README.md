# First_steps_Python

The notebooks contained in this repository are designed to guide your first steps in using Python for hydrology through a series of practical exercises. Each exercise is designed to teach you specific elements of Python such as the data types and syntactic rules.  

The material is organized as follows:

1. **Notebook 1: Python Basics:** Cover some basic elements of the python data types and syntactic rules
2. **Notebook 2: Basic Libraries:** Cover basic elements of some important libraries for data analysis and visualization: *Numpy*, *Pandas* and *Matplotlib*
3. **Notebook 3: Data Retrieval hydrological applications**: Introduces the *data retrieval* package to download hydrological data and provides examples of basic hydrological analyses.     

Most exercises ask to complement or modify pieces of code. If you can't spot the required modification at first (which should happen in most cases), then play around with the provided code. execute it bit-by-bit and try to understand what the specific parts of the code are doing. That should led you to the solution.  

Keep in mind that this material doesn't intend to cover all the basics of Python. Rather, this intend to give you a first glance of what coding looks like. However, after going through the exercises, so you might feel more confident to continue learning with other, more comprehensive, material.
